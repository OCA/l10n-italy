There are a couple of minor issues since l10n_it_delivery_note only
links a Note line of the invoice to the delivery note:

- RiferimentoNumeroLinea refers to a descriptive line, but it should
  enumerate (at least) the products lines
- RiferimentoNumeroLinea is always populated, but it should only be
  populated when the linked lines are not all the invoice lines
