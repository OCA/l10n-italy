This module shows, for each (customer) invoice line, the delivered production
lots that will be also displayed on the invoice report with their corresponding
delivered quantities in case the **Tracking** has been set to **By Lots**.

**Note:** As of v13.0, Odoo provides an option under *Settings* (**Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Traceability**) to **Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Invoices** which provides similar functionality. However, it has some limitations compared to this addon:
* It will only display the associated Lots / Serial Numbers in the generated *Invoice Report*, and not in an extra field in the Invoice view form.
* It will display all the Lots / Serial Numbers grouped together in an extra line in the Invoice Report. This module adds an extra field in each line with that information.

Configuration
=============

* Go to **Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Traceability**, and activate
  option **Lots & Serial Numbers** in order to manage lots in your instance.
* Go to **Sales > Sales > Products** and select or create a storable product
  (Product Type): check that the product has **Tracking** set to **By lots**
  or to **By Unique Serial Number** (in the Inventory tab) and
  **Invoicing Policy** set to **Delivered quantities** (in the Sales tab)

Usage
=====

* Create and validate a sale order
* Set *Lots/Serial Numbers* on the delivered lines by clicking on the button
  *Register lots, packs, location*
* After creating the invoice, the *Lots/Serial Numbers* are displayed in the
  *Production Lots* on the invoice line form and in *formatted note* field on
  the invoice report, and, in case **Tracking** has been selected
  to **By lots**, their corresponding delivered quantities will be displad as
  well.
