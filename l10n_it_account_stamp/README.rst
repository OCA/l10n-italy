Configuration
=============

Go to 'Tax Stamp 2 euro' product and configure 'Stamp taxes' (exemption taxes) under 'Tax stamp' section.

For each invoice, the base amount for each selected tax will be added up and used to determine the application of the account stamp.

Also set income/expense accounts.
Typically income = 'Debiti per bolli' and expense = 'Valori bollati'.

Usage
=====

In invoice form, when applicable, click 'Add tax stamp line' button to add tax stamp as invoice line, thus charging customer.

Otherwise, tax stamp will be anyawy accounted, without charging customer.
